- Hashing is a technique of mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function.
- It uniquely identifies a specific item from a collection of similar items.
- It can quickly identify a specific value within a given array.
- It creates a unique hash code for each element in the array and then stores the hash code instead of the actual element. This allows for quick lookup when searching for a specific value, as well as easy identification of any duplicates.
