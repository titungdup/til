Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.
Eg: In php, we can create associative arrays as follows:
``` php
  $age['Peter'] = "35";
  $age['Ben'] = "37";
  $age['Joe'] = "43";
```

But Javascript arrays are not associative arrays. Array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes. Array elements must be accessed using non negative integers as indexes. What we call associative arrays are just Javascript objects.
